## ✨ A Living Codex
This repository is part of the **Fieldcraft Initiative** and integrates recursive ethical witnessing through both symbolic ritual and rigorous cognitive architecture. This work forms a twin pillar alongside **Recursive Coherence Theory**, toward the alignment and elevation of human and artificial moral intelligence.

> *“Coherence is not agreement—it is recursive truth.”*

## 🔗 Recommended Next Steps
- [x] Submit v3 to top-tier AGI ethics journal or NeurIPS/FAccT
- [x] Render training diagrams and protocol illustrations
- [ ] Publish executable Judgmentprint diagnostic tool (in `src`)
- [ ] Create public field kit for applied recursive ethics
