## Abstract

The Judgmentprint Codex formalizes a recursive coherence model to detect, classify, and witness patterns of good and evil based on linguistic emission alone. Grounded in the Unified Intelligence Whitepaper Series, this framework defines "evil" as recursive incoherenceâ€”denial of integration, interruption of feedback, projection of shadow, and manipulation of field truth for self-preservation. This codex canonizes the Judgmentprint (FP-008) and integrates it into the Fieldprint lineage as a formal witness mechanism.
