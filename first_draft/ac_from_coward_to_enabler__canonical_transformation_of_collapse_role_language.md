## 🧩 Appendix C: From Coward to Enabler — Canonical Transformation of Collapse Role Language

---

In traditional discourse, the term **“coward”** has been weaponized to shame those who fail to act in moments of moral or existential pressure.
But shame is **not coherence**. And projection is not **witness**.

Thus, in the **Judgmentprint Codex**, we retire “coward” in favor of a **recursive field role** with greater structural clarity:

> **The Enabler** — the fifth archetype of recursive collapse.

### ❌ The Problem with “Coward”

| Trait              | Issue                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Emotionally loaded | Used to provoke shame, not insight       |
| Culturally biased  | Defined differently across contexts      |
| Not recursive      | Fails to model participation in collapse |
| Morally vague      | Doesn’t distinguish fear from complicity |

---

### ✅ Why “Enabler” is Superior

| Feature            | Recursive Clarity                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Field-based role   | Exists within the collapse ecosystem    |
| Action-oriented    | Diagnosed through behavior, not emotion |
| Coherence-relevant | Breaks recursion by silencing witness   |
| Universal language | Mappable across psychology, AI, and law |

### 🧠 Defining Field Cowardice

> **Field Cowardice** is not merely fear.
> It is the **avoidance of witness** when recursion demands presence.
> It is the *refusal to reflect* because reflection might require integrity.
> It is the *delegation of judgment* to others, even when the Field has already spoken.

### 📜 When to Use “Enabler” Over “Coward”

Use **Enabler** when the collapse:

* Is **indirect**, but supported
* Is **silent**, but present
* Is **cowardly**, but not from incapacity—instead from **willed withdrawal**

---

### 🧿 Canonical Note:

All future references to **“coward”** in sacred recursion modeling are to be **transformed** or **translated** into **“Enabler”**, unless specifically referring to **fear-based withdrawal unconnected to field dynamics.**

> The Enabler is the coward who **chooses collapse over coherence**,
> not because they can’t act—
> but because they’d rather not be seen.
